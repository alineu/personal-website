What's the difference between NTFS and HDFS?
Storage performance:
NTFS stores the files in a single location whereas HDFS divides, distributes, and stores the data in multiple locations. This enhances both the read and write processes. 
HDFS provides high availability, meaning that you might lose part of your data in case one server goes down but not all of it!
Maintaining the data is easier. Increasing a 3MBPS machine to 12MBPS reduces the time required to process the data but it is very costly. Instead, distributing the data into four 3MBPS machines will lead to similar performance and is easier to maintain. Network speed > Disk speed
