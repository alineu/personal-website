What process the data?

What kind of data is called big data. Let's say a bank has an application server that runs multiple systems in the background: A loan system, debit system, credit etc. where each system has its own corresponding database and the systems constantly communicate with eachother. To facilitate the way company wants to generate insights on the customers.



Customer representatives constantly require monthly reports of their customers. This includes different analytical reports using the customers' loan, debit, and credit data. Considering the huge amount of customer data in the data lake, using RDBMS is not efficient mainly due to the sequential processing scheme and the long time that would be required. While generating daily reports from customer data might be doable using traditional systems, 30-day period analytics simply can not be processed using such systems. This kind of data where you can not process usng traditional batch management systems. A collection of data sets (Terabytes or Petabytes) so large and complex that it becomes difficult and time consuming to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing pipelines and applications.

For example, New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) generates about one TB of new trade data per day to perform stock trading analytics to determine trends for optimal trades

IBM defines big data as a collection of data that satisfies three criteria:
<li>Volume: How big is the data? (>1TB)</li>
<li>Velocity: At what rate the new data is being received</li>
An airplane generates about 1TB of data every 30 minutes! Facebook generates 6 Petabytes of data every day! 
This data is gathered from different sources:
<ul>
<li>Online</li>
<li>Batch</li>
<li>Streaming</li>
<li>Sensors</li>
</ul>
<li>Variety: Structured, unstructured, and semi-structured</li>

You have to process big data because that is what ultimately leads to insights and actions which in turn bring revenue to the company. 
For example, Amazon uses services that require big data analytics:
Recommendation engines that suggest relevant products according to the user history and the item that the user is looking for.
Similarly, Ad Trageting personalizes the offers appearing in the website/app according to the user history
Abuse and Click Frad Detection is another services that uses big data analytics
